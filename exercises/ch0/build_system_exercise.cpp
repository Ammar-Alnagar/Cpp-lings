/*
 * Chapter 0 Exercise: Build Systems
 * 
 * Create a Makefile for this program that:
 * 1. Compiles this file into an executable named "build_exercise"
 * 2. Uses C++17 standard
 * 3. Includes warning flags (-Wall -Wextra)
 * 4. Has a "clean" target that removes the executable
 * 
 * The program should compile and run correctly after implementing the Makefile.
